EW282D Introductory Comparative Biomechanics Lab

## Throw out rubrics and handouts
This course has none. We meet, ask research questions, then try out (hands on) biomechanics gear to answer the questions. 

## Course repository on Github
The course repository is on Github at [https://github.com/devangel77b/ew282d]. Final projects are contained as submodules and available individually under [https://github.com/ew282d-evangelista]. Eventually I'll probably migrate the 282d master directory...
